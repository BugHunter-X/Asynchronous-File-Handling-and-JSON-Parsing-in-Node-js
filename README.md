## Asynchronous File Handling and JSON Parsing in Node.js

This example demonstrates a robust approach to handling asynchronous operations in Node.js, focusing on file reading and JSON parsing. It showcases proper error handling within asynchronous callbacks to prevent unhandled exceptions and ensure application stability.

### Bug Description

The original code snippet reads a file asynchronously and attempts to parse its content as JSON. While functionally correct, it lacks comprehensive error handling.  If an error occurs during file reading or JSON parsing, the error might not be handled gracefully, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes.

### Solution

The provided solution enhances the original code by incorporating error handling mechanisms within the asynchronous callbacks for both file reading and JSON parsing.  This ensures that any errors encountered during these operations are caught and handled appropriately, preventing unhandled exceptions.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling in asynchronous Node.js applications, ensuring robustness and preventing unexpected behavior.
